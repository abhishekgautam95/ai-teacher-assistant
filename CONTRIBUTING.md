## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code Style

* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow existing code formatting
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused
